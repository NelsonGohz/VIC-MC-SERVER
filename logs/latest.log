[17:03:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> yeah
[17:03:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <DesWorld> max is how many golem
[17:04:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <DesWorld> i saw 2
[17:04:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> depend of the amount of vilalgers
[17:04:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <DesWorld> damn it
[17:04:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> can go up to 4-6 even
[17:04:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> for this amount of vilalger we got
[17:04:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <DesWorld> this is bad
[17:04:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> they wont despawn too, only till death
[17:04:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> i think
[17:05:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <DesWorld> Villagers can summon iron golems. A villager desires a golem if the villager has gone to bed in the past 20 minutes and has not detected a golem in the past 30 seconds
[17:05:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <s0pis0ap> wtf they got sleep meh
[17:05:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> i see
[17:05:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> so eventually they cannot summon ler
[17:05:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <DesWorld> got more
[17:05:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <s0pis0ap> anyways iron golem not a problem tho
[17:05:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <s0pis0ap> help protect us? lol
[17:05:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <DesWorld> problem
[17:05:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <DesWorld> coz our zombie will die
[17:05:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <s0pis0ap> ohh
[17:06:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> eventually wont spawn golems
[17:06:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <s0pis0ap> nvm we make them enter the hole first
[17:06:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> after 20 min
[17:06:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <s0pis0ap> where to find more villagers
[17:07:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> need to breed them
