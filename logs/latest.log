[00:19:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> the block on dun need
[00:19:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> cone one still good
[00:19:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> dun think so
[00:20:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> not sure how to yet
[00:20:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> can just mine it
[00:20:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> btw the difference of ice
[00:20:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> Blue ice is a solid block similar to packed ice and ice, but much more slippery.
[00:20:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> blue ice more op/faster i think
[00:21:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> Blue ice naturally generates on the bottom of the icebergs and as large arching structures in frozen ocean biomes.
[00:21:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> seems very limited
[00:21:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> 9 packed ice = 1 blue ice
[00:21:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> ice = pack ice = blue ice
[00:22:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> means can farm
[00:22:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> at ice biome
[00:22:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> when it snow stoems
[00:22:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <VictorPage> and water body
